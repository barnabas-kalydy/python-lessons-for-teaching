"""
✨ This Python file serves as a demonstration of f-strings in Python.
It includes examples and explanations of how to use f-strings for string formatting.
"""

# 🎉 Example 1: Basic usage
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"Example 1 - Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# 📊 Example 2: Arithmetic operations within f-strings
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
print(f"Example 2 - The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}.")

# 🌟 Example 3: Using f-strings with dictionary values
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
print(f"Example 3 - {person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")

# 💡 Example 4: Calling methods within f-strings
sentence = "hello, world"
print(f"Example 4 - The capitalized version of '{sentence}' is '{sentence.capitalize()}'.")
 
# 🚀 Example 5: Formatting floating-point numbers
pi = 3.141592653589793
print(f"Example 5 - The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}.")

# Tasks:
# 🎈 Create a variable called 'city' with the value 'New York' and print "I live in New York."
# 📅 Create variables 'day' and 'month' with values 14 and 3 respectively, and print "Today is the 14th of March."
# 🍕 Create variables 'pizza_count' and 'price_per_pizza' with values 3 and 10 respectively, and print "The total cost of 3 pizzas is $30."
# 🎁 Create a variable 'gift' with the value 'flowers' and print "I received flowers as a gift."
# 🌞 Create variables 'celsius' and 'fahrenheit' with values 25 and the corresponding conversion, and print "25°C is equal to 77°F."
# 🍔 Create variables 'name' and 'age' with values "John" and 35 respectively, and print "My name is John and I am 35 years old."
# 💭 Create a variable 'sentence' with a long sentence, and print the number of characters in it.
# 📚 Create variables 'author' and 'book_title' with values "J.K. Rowling" and "Harry Potter", and print "The author of 'Harry Potter' is J.K. Rowling."
