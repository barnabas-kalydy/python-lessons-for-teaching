"""
🐍 This Python file serves as a demonstration of basic data types in Python.
It includes examples and explanations of integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
"""

# Integers
# 🔢 Example 1: Define an integer variable
num1 = 10
print("Example 1 - Integer variable:", num1)

# Floats
# 🌊 Example 2: Define a float variable
num2 = 3.14
print("Example 2 - Float variable:", num2)

# Strings
# 📝 Example 3: Define a string variable
name = "John"
print("Example 3 - String variable:", name)

# Booleans
# ✔️ Example 4: Define a boolean variable
is_student = True
print("Example 4 - Boolean variable:", is_student)

# Lists
# 📋 Example 5: Define a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print("Example 5 - List:", fruits)

# Tuples - immutable sequences
# 🍇 Example 6: Define a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
# This will result an error:
# coordinates[0] = 1
print("Example 6 - Tuple:", coordinates)

# Dictionaries
# 📚 Example 7: Define a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print("Example 7 - Dictionary:", person.get("name"))

# Tasks:
# 🎯 Create a list containing the names of your three favorite movies.
# 📅 Create a tuple representing the current date (year, month, day).
# 📚 Create a dictionary representing information about your favorite book (title, author, publication year).
# 🚦 Define a boolean variable indicating whether it's raining outside or not.
# 🎒 Create a list containing the names of your three favorite subjects in school.
# 📱 Create a dictionary representing information about your smartphone (brand, model, year of release).
# 🥤 Define a float variable representing the price of a can of soda.
# 🧩 Create a list containing the ages of your family members.
