# 🔢 Example 1: While loop with condition based on user input
number = int(input("Enter a number greater than 10: "))
while number <= 10:
    print("Number is not greater than 10.")
    number = int(input("Enter a number greater than 10: "))
print("Number is greater than 10.")

# Tasks:
# 😎 Write a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.
# 📏 Write a while loop to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.
# 🤔 Write a while loop to find the first Fibonacci number greater than 1000.
# 😄 Write a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a password until they enter "password123".
# 🤝 Search for an example on the internet on how to use break and continue with while (or for) loops
# 🌈 Write a while loop to generate random numbers between 1 and 10 until a 7 is generated.
# 🎲 Write a while loop to check if a given number is a palindrome.
# 🌟 Write a while loop to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.
